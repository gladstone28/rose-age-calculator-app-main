## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned


I learned to add code snippets to markup docs, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want help with writing markdown, just check out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).


### Continued development

In the future I sant to focus on the following.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JA library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React Framework


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.codepen.io) - This helped me to learn to do front-end coding. 
- [Example resource 2](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-intermediate-css/lessons/learn-css-variables/exercises/learn-css-variables-review) - This is a a good lesson which helped me finally understand css variables.
